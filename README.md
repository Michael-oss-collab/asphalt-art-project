Unit 1 project for Comp Sci A.
# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built-in Neighborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - My project is a painting of a creeper face from minecraft on a 32x32 grid. I painted the background green and used methods to paint the creeper's eyes and mouth. 

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - Two things about my project that i am prpud of is how I used methods to paint the eyes and mouth and how the creeper face that I created looks identical to the real creeper face.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - Something that I might improve or do differently if I had an opportunity to change something about my project would to make the background not the same green but maybe some parts of it would be darker green or lighter green to show contrast and add more detail.
